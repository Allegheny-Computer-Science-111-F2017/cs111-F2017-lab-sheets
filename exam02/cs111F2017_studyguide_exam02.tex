\section*{Introduction}

This course will have its final exam on Friday, \assignmentduedate{}, 2017 from 9:00 am to 12:00 noon. The exam will be
``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will cover the following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on
the Web site for the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this date. Students may post questions
about this material to our Slack team. The instructor encourages students to form study groups to review for this
upcoming examination.

\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Chapter One in Lewis \& Loftus (i.e., ``Introduction to Computation and Programming'')

  \item Chapter Two in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 2.1--2.9 (i.e., ``Data and Expressions'')

  \item Chapter Three in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 3.1--3.7 (i.e., ``Using Classes and Objects'')

  \item Chapter Four in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 4.1--4.9 (i.e., ``Writing Classes'')

  \item Chapter Five in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 5.1--5.6 (i.e., ``Conditionals and Loops'')

  \item Chapter Six in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 6.1--6.4 (i.e., ``More Conditionals and Loops'')

  \item Chapter Eight in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 8.1--8.4 (i.e., ``Arrays'')

  \item Chapter Eleven in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 11.1--11.6 (e.g., ``Exceptions'')

  \item Chapter Twelve in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 12.1--12.3 (e.g., ``Recursion'')

  \item Using the many commands in the Linux operating system; editing in {\tt gvim}, compiling and executing
    programs in Linux; knowledge of the basic commands for using {\tt git} and GitHub.

  \item Your class notes and lecture slides, labs 1--10, practicals 1--10, and the handouts from lab.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Like the past quiz and exam, this exam will be a mix of questions that have a form such as fill in the
blank, short answer, true/false, and completion. The emphasis will be on the following topics:

\vspace*{-.05in}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Fundamental concepts in computing and the Java language (e.g., definitions and background).

  \item Fundamental concepts in programming languages (e.g., conditional logic and iteration).

  \item Advanced concepts in programming languages (e.g., exception handling and recursion).

  \item Practical laboratory techniques (e.g., editing, compiling, and running programs; effectively using files and
    directories; correctly using GitHub through the command-line {\tt git} program).

  \item Understanding Java programs (e.g., given a short, perhaps even one line, source code segment written in Java,
    understand what it does and be able to precisely describe its output).

  \item Composing Java statements and programs, given a description of what should be done. Students should be completely
    comfortable writing short source code statements that are in nearly correct form as Java code. While your program may
    contain small syntactic errors, it is not acceptable to ``make up'' features of the Java programming language that do
    not exist in the language itself---so, please do not call a ``{\tt solveQuestionThree()}'' method!

\end{itemize}

\noindent No partial credit will be given for questions that are true/false, completion, or fill in the blank. Minimal
partial credit may be awarded for the questions that require a student to write a short answer. You are strongly
encouraged to write short, precise, and correct responses to all of the questions. When you are taking the exam, you
should do so as a ``point maximizer'' who first responds to the questions that you are most likely to answer correctly
for full points. Please make sure that you review the past quiz so that you can comfortably answer its questions.
Students should keep the time limitation in mind as they are absolutely required to submit the examination at the end of
the class period unless they have written permission for extra time from a member of the Learning Commons. Students who
do not submit their exam on time will have their overall point total reduced. Please see the course instructor if you
have questions about these policies.

\section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

\noindent Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the completion of this exam. More details about
the Allegheny College Honor Code are provided on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review the
full statement of the Honor Code before taking this exam.

\noindent The following provides you with a review of Honor Code statement from the course syllabus:

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny
Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations,
laboratory assignments, and the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor
Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

\begin{quote}
  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the
  integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.
\end{quote}

\noindent Students who have questions about Allegheny College's Honor Code and how it applies to the completion of a
quiz or an examination in Computer Science 111, should immediately schedule a meeting with the course instructor to
openly discuss their questions and concerns.
